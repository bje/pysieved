pysieved: Python Managesieve Server
===================================

This is a GPL managesieve server.  It uses a plug-in architecture to
support different authentication, homedir lookup, and storage
back-ends.

Originally written by Neale Pickett for use with avelsieve (SquirrelMail),
Postfix and Dovecot.  It should work with other managesieve clients too.
Please share with us your successes and failures.


Plugin architecture
-------------------

The server ships with the following plug-ins:

Authentication:

* [Dovecot](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pages/Dovecot)
* /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))
* PAM
* SASL
* LDAP ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))
* MySQL

Homedir lookup & session initiation:

* Dovecot
* /etc/passwd
* LDAP
* MySQL
* simple virtual hosting (eg. /var/lib/virtual/username)

Storage:

* Dovecot
* Exim


Additional back-ends are easy to write, just copy one of the existing
back-ends and start hacking.  No modifications are needed to any
existing code, so you don't have to worry about things like the
managesieve protocol or forking.


Download
--------

Version 1.1 was released on March 7, 2010, rolling the long-pending
support for Exim into an official release.

You can get the latest version [as a tarball](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/archive-tarball/master),
or with git:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved.git

A [web view of revisions](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved) is
also available for those without git.

If you like being on the bleeding edge, try the [dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev)


Installation
------------

Put all the files somewhere, for instance /usr/local/lib/pysieved.
Copy pysieved.ini into /usr/local/etc/, and edit to taste.  It's
commented.

To run from inetd, add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

    sieve  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/bin/python python /usr/local/lib/pysieved/pysieved.py --inetd

To run as a daemon, just run

    python pysieved.py
