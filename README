== pysieved: Python Managesieve Server ==

This is a GPL managesieve server.  It uses a plug-in architecture to
support different authentication, homedir lookup, and storage
back-ends.

I wrote this so I could use avelsieve (SquirrelMail) with Postfix
and Dovecot.  It should work with other managesieve clients too.
Please share with me your successes and failures.

Download
--------

You can get the latest version [as
a tarball](http://woozle.org/~neale/repos/pysieved/pysieved.tar.gz),
or with darcs:

    darcs get http://woozle.org/~neale/repos/pysieved


Plugin architecture
-------------------

The server ships with the following plug-ins:

Authentication:

* PAM
* SASL
* MySQL

Homedir lookup & session initiation:

* /etc/passwd
* MySQL
* simple virtual hosting (eg. /var/lib/virtual/username)

Storage:

* Dovecot


Additional back-ends are easy to write, just copy one of the existing
back-ends and start hacking.  No modifications are needed to any
existing code, so you don't have to worry about things like the 
managesieve protocol or forking.


Installing
----------

Put all the files somewhere.  I put mine in /usr/local/lib/pysieved.
Copy pysieved.ini into /usr/local/etc/, and edit to taste.  It's
commented.

To run from inetd, add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

    sieve  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/bin/python python /usr/local/lib/pysieved/pysieved.py --inetd

To run as a daemon, just run

    python pysieved.py


Testing
-------

There is a big beefy test suite, but some tests might fail on your
system because they rely on the way mine is set up.  Don't panic.
