pysieved: Python Managesieve Server
===================================

This is a GPL managesieve server.  It uses a plug-in architecture to
support different authentication, homedir lookup, and storage
back-ends.

Originally written by Neale Pickett for use with avelsieve (SquirrelMail),
Postfix and Dovecot.  It should work with other managesieve clients too.
Please share with us your successes and failures.


Plugin architecture
-------------------

The server ships with the following plug-ins:

Authentication:

* [Dovecot](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pages/Dovecot)
* /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))
* PAM
* SASL
* LDAP ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))
* MySQL
* Courier ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))

Homedir lookup & session initiation:

* Dovecot
* /etc/passwd
* LDAP
* MySQL
* simple virtual hosting (eg. /var/lib/virtual/username)

Storage:

* Dovecot (.dovecot.sieve)
* Exim (.forward)
* MySQL ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))
* lmtpd ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))

Consumer ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev)):

* Dovecot
* [Exim](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pages/Exim)
* lmtpd ([dev branch](http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pysieved/commits/dev))

Additional back-ends are easy to write, just copy one of the existing
back-ends and start hacking.  No modifications are needed to any
existing code, so you don't have to worry about things like the
managesieve protocol or forking.
